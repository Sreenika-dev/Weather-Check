To use this application, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and set it in the .env file. Instructions for obtaining the key are provided in the README file.

This project was created as a learning exercise for React JS and APIs. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own weather app or to suggest improvements or new features.
